## Motivation

As a youth from southern Fujian (Hokkien), entrepreneurial spirit runs in my family's and my own bones. From a young age, we were instilled with the concept that one must become their own "boss" and setup their own business. In my heart, I firmly believe that I belong to the business world (maybe not the academic one).<br>

## OpenIoT Team

During undergraduate, my two roommates and I co-founded a tech group called **OpenIoT**. With an entrepreneurial spirit in technology, we participated in numerous innovation and entrepreneurship competitions. As of 2024, the OpenIoT team has grown to include 28 official members and has accumulated a total of six national-level competition awards and over $20000 funding.<br>
